The main problem we study here is **irregularities in intracellular traffic in axons** caused by **mutations in molecular motors**. This can lead to **“traffic jams”** (local accumulation of transported cargo). In addition, such jams may cause **axon swelling**, which is associated with various **neurodegenerative diseases**. We treat this as an **engineering problem** and build a **mathematical model** of traffic-jam formation during **molecular-motor-assisted transport** of intracellular organelles, using **transport equations** developed by **Smith and Simmons**.
